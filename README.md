# PCB_sim_java
Simple PCB simulator in Java

<h2> Details </h2>
<p> This program was created for the Principles of Operating Systems course at Bishop's University
for the winter 2018 semester.</p>
<p> The purpose of this program is to create a simulation of a Process Control Block. The user will
first be prompted to enter the number of devices that will be available in their simulated CPU and
will then be offered a list of several interrupts that they are allowed to enter. These interrupts
can add processes, call for an I/O on the current process being run, move processes to and from
devices, along with several other options.</p>
